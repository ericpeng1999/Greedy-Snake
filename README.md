# Greedy-Snake
This is my final project of Appl 413 in Summer â… , 2020. Here I created a replicate of the classic game "Gready Snake" using LabView.

The players can set the dimensions of the map and can control the motion of the snake by the arrow keys on the keyboard.

The game screen is created using the 2-D LED array provided in LabView. Since there is no way to change the color of individual LED for a 2-D LED array in LabView, the color of the food and the snake are the same.
